## Test setup

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Lark test base, Etsy test shop, and test API access for Suppliers 1 and 2 (primary) and Supplier 3 (backup). Supplier 1 standard production days = 4. |
| Test data | 2 shops. 3 Product Types: MUG-11OZ (mapped to Supplier 1), TSHIRT-UNISEX (mapped to Supplier 2), POSTER-A3 (no active mapping). 6 SKUs, written here as SKU-A to SKU-F, each listed on one test shop; real SKUs use the task format, for example 061026-Dung-05. SKU-A and SKU-B (MUG-11OZ), SKU-C (TSHIRT-UNISEX), SKU-D (POSTER-A3), SKU-E (a wrong SKU on an Etsy listing; no Product/SKU record in Lark), SKU-F (MUG-11OZ, no standard artwork link). Orders: normal, with personalization text, missing details, incomplete address, quantity 0, one order (10482) with two lines for two suppliers, a line the preferred supplier cannot fulfill, ship-by date tomorrow, expected to miss the ship-by date, stuck in production, open High exceptions with no owner. Cases: Design (D1 on a Supplier 1 line, with a replacement artwork file; D2 assigned to another Designer), Supplier, Customer. |
| Users | PD&CS accounts with the PD (mapping owner) permission or the CS permission, plus one account each for Designer, Team Lead, Management and Developer |
| Priority | P1 = must pass before the release that contains the test goes live (Release column). P2 = can go live with a written workaround. |
| Exit criteria | For each release: all P1 test cases for that release pass and no P1 defect is open (FRD §11). |
| Status values | Pass, Fail, Blocked, Not run (blank until the test is run). |
| Technical checks | TC-05b, TC-05c, TC-07d, TC-09c and TC-12b need a test tool or a simulated failure. The Developer runs them and a business user witnesses the result. They stay in this pack because they protect business behavior: no duplicate orders, no missing orders, and no silent send, status-update or tracking failure. |
| Not in UAT | Peak-season effort for BR-04 is checked in release R5 with real data (FRD §11). The hourly schedule (NFR-01) is a technical check: the Developer confirms it in R1. In UAT the check is started by hand, so UAT tests the exception rules, not the schedule. Team Lead (view only) and Developer (admin) access are confirmed at role setup in R1. |

## Summary

| Measure | Count |
|---|---|
| Total test cases | 34 |
| P1 (must pass before its release goes live) | 33 |
| P2 (can go live with a workaround) | 1 |
| Negative test cases | 13 |
| Technical checks (Developer runs, users witness) | 5 |

| User story | Priority | Release | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| US-03 | P1 | R1 | Not run |

**Preconditions:** MUG-11OZ is mapped to Supplier 1. SKU-A and SKU-B belong to MUG-11OZ. Line L9 (SKU-A) is Ready to send with Supplier 1. Line L10 (SKU-A) is Sent to supplier with Supplier 1.

**Steps:**

1. Log in as a user with the PD (mapping owner) permission.
2. Map MUG-11OZ to Supplier 2 from today.
3. Place a new test order with SKU-A and SKU-B.
4. Open L9 and L10.
