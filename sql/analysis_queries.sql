-- AugBridge Commerce - analysis queries used in BRD section 5.1
-- Data: SIMULATED 12-week dataset (10,685 orders). Tables: see schema.sql.
-- Full dataset (in ../data/): augbridge_simulated.db (SQLite), or orders.csv and issues.csv.
-- The results below are the actual output of each query on the full dataset.
-- BRD section 5.1 shows Q2 only, because Q2 returns both the weekly volume
-- and the overdue rate. Q1 and Q3 are kept here as supporting queries.
--
-- Labels (same as the BRD):
--   By design  = the result comes from a value set in the simulation
--   Downstream = calculated from values set in the simulation, but not set directly
-- None of these results is a real-world finding.

-- Q1. Weekly order volume (By design)
-- Supports: ~7x peak volume (week 10 = 2,750 orders vs 400/week average).

-- Q2. Overdue rate by week (Downstream)
-- Overdue = order-to-delivery time above 10 business days.
-- Context only: it includes internal, supplier and carrier time, which this
-- dataset cannot separate. It is not a target for the project.

-- Q3. Issue rate: peak vs normal weeks (By design)
-- Context only. It is not used as evidence in the BRD: the need for a shared
-- issue record (AP-10) comes from the process, not from this simulated rate.
